This is the first public release of the Waffle Sites Open Framework. You can use this software to 
build basic websites, with User, Content, and Layout Management, and Application development. Users
can run basic profiles, as well as styled websites, much like a Tumblr website. 

TO INSTALL:
Head to /modules/settings.php and set up your Database settings, and then import the tables from 
/modules/tables.sql. From there, you can login and the system will mark you as a user. You mus then head to 
the database and edit your userlevel in thable "users" to 4. From then on, you are the Superuser of the website, 
and can control your website and it's members.

This site is still in it's early stages, so there is not an auto install script yet. Some functions may be buggy, and 
some functions may not "exist" yet. I am still working on the site, and will be regularly pushing updates to this
repository. The core system modules should be working as is, the main focus right now is developing the applications,
for example, profile websites.
